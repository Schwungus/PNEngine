# PNEngine

PNEngine is a fully external 3D engine for GameMaker with support for modding
and local/online multiplayer with up to 4 players.

## Multiplayer (EXPERIMENTAL)

These steps require the developer console, which you can open by pressing `~`
(`Ã–` on Nordic keyboard layouts) on Windows.

### Local

PNEngine uses input device hotswapping by default. If you want to add other
players using separate input devices, type `config in_mode 1` into the console
to enable join mode (use value `2` to revert back to hotswap). If you save your
current settings after doing this, it will persist until you reset your
settings to defaults.

You can assign a new player to an input device by pressing any button on it.
Once assigned, that player is readied and will be able to play when the level
changes.

Players can unready or leave the game by pressing `Backspace` on their keyboard
or `Select` on their gamepad.

### Online

Online multiplayer uses delay-based netcode, so you need minimal latency
between players for a smooth experience.
Desyncs entirely depend on the mods that users have enabled and whether or not
they are properly scripted for full determinism.

You need to be in the title screen (use the console command `title` as a
shortcut) in order to host a netgame with `host [port]`. Other players will
then be able to connect to it using `connect <ip> [port]`.

Note that only a single local player may be active at a time and input modes
will not function while a netgame is active.
